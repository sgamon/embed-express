# embed-express

[![npm package](https://nodei.co/npm/embed-express.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/embed-express/)

Embed a very minimal express server in the current folder.

  
## Why?

You started a little front-end project by creating a folder and putting files
in it... then you thought "It would be handy to have a little web server here,
to service ajax requests." At this point, your fingers fly to the console:

    npx embed-express
    
Voila! 


## Installation notes

Start in a folder that needs an express.

## Configuration

By default, the express server runs on port 3001. 
You can override that by setting the PORT evironment variable.
